-- Court Rotation Generator: record the deployed pg_cron expiry cleanup.
-- The production job was first observed running at 2026-09-28 17:00 UTC.
-- 20260928170000 is a source-record version identifier chosen for this
-- migration; it is not asserted to be the job's creation timestamp.
-- pg_cron does not expose a creator timestamp, so this migration records the
-- deployed job without asserting who created it.
-- The job is created only when the expected job name is absent, so replaying
-- this migration is idempotent and will not create a duplicate.
